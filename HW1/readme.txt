Please comply to the following guidelines in submitting your homework:

1. Please name your verilog file as "alu.v".
2. Name your top module as "alu", and DO NOT modify the port name of alu.
3. Put your verilog file in the same directory as the testbench.
4. Then you can type "make run" in command line, the simulation program will be compiled and executed.
5. For the usage of verilator, please refer to the "Demo" section in the Users' Guide link below.
6. In the input.txt, we only provide two simple test patterns, you need to try more complex test patterns to verify your design.
7. If the number of  patterns is greater than 20, you should modify the MAX_SIM_TIME in top.cpp.
8. Each row in the input.txt is one test pattern, these numbers represent  op, rs1, rs2, rd, zero, overflow, respectively.
9. Please upload ONLY the "alu.v" file (don't compress it)
